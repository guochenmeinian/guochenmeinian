### <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Developer.gif" width="45" /> About Me:
- 🏫 I am currently a Master's student at [NYU Courant](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic) studying Computer Science. I completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer and Information Science at [the Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu)
- 📝 I (sometimes) write blogs at my personal [website](https://guochenmeinian.github.io/).
- 🔭 Last summer, I interned as a Software Engineer at Bilibili, often referred to as the "YouTube of China." This summer, I am seeking an internship focused on Machine Learning Engineering.
- 💻 This semester, I took courses in LLMs, Reinforcement Learning, and DevOps, and worked on related projects including:
  - Building a multi-agent RL system for collaborative gameplay: [Link](https://guochenmeinian.github.io/bomberland_rl_report/).
